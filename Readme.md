This is my small project for tracking my daily coding activities out of the work. 

In the January 2017 I read Alexander Kallaway's new year resolution for [#100DaysOfCode Challenge](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/start-2017-with-the-100daysofcode-improved-and-updated-18ce604b237b)
I like the idea. Unfortunately since February 2017 I am full time software developer and I code in my work whole day. 

On the other hand I want to constantly improve and work on my own projects. But not all my work can be seen despite more and more of my projects is also open-source and placed here at GitHub. 

Thus I decided to run a diary about what I am daily coding after my work.
